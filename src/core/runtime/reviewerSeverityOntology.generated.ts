Preferred CLI form: `--finding \"P1:Title|ref1,ref2\"` (maps to `finding.refs`).\n2. If a single ref contains a comma, escape it as `\\,` inside the `--finding` value.\n3. Envelope-level `--ref` values are optional generic artifacts only; they do not satisfy blocker finding evidence binding.\n4. If a `P0/P1` finding has no finding-level refs, PASS is rejected.\n\n## Decision Mapping\n\n1. Any `P0/P1` present: reviewer should request a fix cycle.\n2. Only `P2/P3`: reviewer should prefer convergence with notes (policy rollout dependent).\n3. Clean: reviewer converges.\n\n## Operational Use\n\nThis file is intended to be:\n1. Referenced by optimization/tracker docs.\n2. Reflected in reviewer prompt templates and handoff guidance.\n3. Used as review calibration baseline in loop metrics analysis.";

Goals: Keep `P0/P1/P2/P3` stable across rounds. Prevent severity inflation and deflation. Make reviewer decisions predictable and auditable. Scope This ontology applies to reviewer findings in Pairflow loops. It does not replace task acceptance criteria; it complements them. Runtime Reminder Block (Build Source) The block below is the canonical source for runtime reviewer reminder text. It is consumed by a build/codegen step and embedded into TypeScript so runtime prompts do not depend on reading this markdown file from disk. Blocker severities (`P0/P1`) require concrete evidence (repro, failing check output, or precise code-path proof). Without blocker-grade evidence (`P0/P1`), downgrade to `P2` by default. Cosmetic/comment-only findings are `P3`. Out-of-scope observations should be notes (`P3`), not mandatory fix findings.
